## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Branching and Committing

Create A branch with project code example TT-01_new_branch_name

Commit Message : use the same code for committing the code : TT-1 New Commit Name

hint: Start your commit message like this, say this in your head.

"This commited if used will" and start writing your commit message after this.
Example:

        if you fixed a erro on page button, your commit message would be something like
        This commited if used will Fix the submit error on main landing page
        This commited if used will - goes in your head
        Fix the submit error on main landing page - Actual Commit message

        Final Message would be :

        TT-53 Fix the submit error on main landing page
